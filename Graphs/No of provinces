adj matrix is given convert to list
run for loop for matrix id matrix[i][j]==1 and i is not equal to j means there is path  // if i==j self path
create adj list
create a visited array init to 0
run for loop over the nodes 
if not visted , increase cnt- as new component & run dfs over the adj list

in dfs 
first mark vis[node] as 1
for(auto it: adj[node])
if not visited 
dfs(it, adj, vis)-- recursion solves it


as cnt only increases when new component node is seen and dfs recursion solves it internally
retun cnt for ans
