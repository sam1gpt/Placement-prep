used kahns algo
check strings pairwise, find min len between those 2 pairs
and iterate my keeping ptr on both strings if they are unequal then 
put it into an adjacency list
adj[s1[ptr]-'a'].push_back(s2[ptr]-'a']; // to conert to numeric
and break from loops

call a topo vector and put in topo sort function having its algo
declare ans string 
iterate over topo vector
and do ans= ans+ char(it+'a') //to convert back to string
return ans

edge case conditions
in topo function check for cycle condition do topo.size< number of vertices or something
also if all characters are same put it in else if of s1!=s2 condition and 
return empty in both conditions
