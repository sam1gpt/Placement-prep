use bfs along with distance array concept
mark dist array init as 1e9 // we mark as max initially as want min dist
have q push src as well as init dist src as 0
do bfs using q
main logic is if that dist[node]+1 < dist[it] means it is shorter way to reach that node
then dist[it]= dist[node]+1 and push it in q

if dist array is still marked 1e9 means there is cycle then do dist[i]=1e9
return dist
