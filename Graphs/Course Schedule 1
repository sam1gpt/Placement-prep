run kahns algo with bfs and cnt var to check if cnt== numCourses if thats true means there is no cycle because of topo sort
small modification when checking indegree and we have to initiallize indegree based on prerequisites just

        for(auto edge: prerequisites){
            int u= edge[0];
            int v= edge[1];
            adj[v].push_back(u);
            indegree[u]++;
        }

edge[1]->edge[0] in adj list, meaning indegree increase  will be at u so indegree[u]++
