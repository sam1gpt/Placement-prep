first approach keep 2 arrays one traversing from left and other from right, init leftmost and rightmost to 1
in left traversal if elem right is greater increase its val from left[i] +=1
vice versa from right
find max of left right by running another for loop
retun sum by suing accumulate or running another for loop

method 2: slope
init i to 1 while its less than array size
if elem next to it equal sum++, i++ and continue
take peak and down var to 1
while i<n && elem left is smaller increase peak and sum+= peak and i by 1
similarly if left is greater increase sum== down and sown and i by 1
if down>peak sum+=down-peak

return sum
