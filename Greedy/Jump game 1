keep maxind and i cntr and run for loop
if i> maxind return false
else maxind= max(maxind, i+arr[i])
return true

logic is we find maxind that can be reached if we encounter index greater than max its not possible,as how can we arrive here if max is less 
return false in that case
else we find maxind and if maxind is  greater than size of array means we can definitely reach the end
