divide problem into 3 parts, one which do not overlap completely and are smaller, the ones which dont overlap and are completely larger and the ones who do
if new intervals start is bigger than any intervals end, that means it is to the left and doesnt overlap at all
else we check if newIntervals end is greater than or equal to any intervals end that means these overlap and hence we try to find the range
that is min of intervals and newIntervals start and max of these 2 ends and push it into array
if start of interval is larger than end of newInterval, these also dont overlap and push the remaining in array
