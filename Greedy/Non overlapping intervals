we basically sort array based on end time using comparator
we keep last as end time of first interval and cnt as 1
if intervals beginning is greater than or equal to end of last we increase cnt and keep last as that intervals end
subtracting size from cnt gives us the min no of intervals to be removed to get non overlapping intervals
