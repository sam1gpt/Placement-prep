question is can we return bills, each lemonade costs 5 dollar and we have bills array having 5,10,20 dollars
keep five and ten variable
traverse thru array
if bills[i]==5 five+=1
else if its ten
  if five is there decrease five by 1 and increase ten by 1
  else return false
else // meaning 20 dollar
  if ten and five decrease each by 1
  else if five>=3 decrease by 3
  else return false

return true
