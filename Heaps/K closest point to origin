we want closest point to origin meaning min distance in heap hence create max heap to pop out ones with largest dist

create max heap with {{dist, pait<int,int>}} having element

calculate dist= square of 1st element + 2nd one , mx will get popped out when size>k

while heap isnt empty
push elements in res vector
and pop element out
