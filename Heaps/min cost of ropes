basically create min heap to get 2 smallest elem each time, add them and then push them back so that next 2 smallest can come added and pushed back and so on 
so that we get smallest cost

push all elem into minh

check while size>=2 // while loop
get top elem and pop // mark this as first
get next top elem and pop // mark  this as 2nd

store a total cost var= total+ first +second

push back first+ second back into min heap
