Use hashing a left pointer and right pointer
Check while right< size of window
create hash array all initialized to -1
if hash array is not -1 means that array is in hash
if hash[s[r]]>=l meaning repeating character
l= hash[s[r]] +1
otherwise
length= r-l+1
maxlen= max of maxlen and length
hash[s[r]]=r
r++
