basically have a maximum element for each element from left and right arrays // mxl, mxr
init left array with height[0] and right with height[n-1]
run for loop from left and other with right from size-2
the mxl stores max of previous and current height and vice versa for mxr
find min of mxl and mxr for each element and subtract the height of that elem gives rainwater stored at that particular element
add all to give sum
